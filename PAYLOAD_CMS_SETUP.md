PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-secret-key-change-this-in-production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/workflo_cms
```

### 2. Database Setup

Create a PostgreSQL database named `workflo_cms` (or use your preferred name and update the DATABASE_URL).

### 3. Initial Setup and Seeding

Run the following commands to set up the CMS:

```bash

## API Usage

### Using the Payload API Helper

// Get published services by category
const managedITServices = await payloadAPI.getServices({
  category: 'managed-it',
  status: 'published',
  limit: 10
})

// Get featured testimonials
const featuredTestimonials = await payloadAPI.getTestimonials({
  featured: true,
  limit: 5
})

// Get latest blog posts
const recentPosts = await payloadAPI.getBlogPosts({
  limit: 3,
  page: 1
})

// Get site settings
const siteSettings = await payloadAPI.getSiteSettings()
```

### Direct Payload Client Usage

```typescript
import { getPayloadClient } from '@/lib/payload'

const payload = await getPayloadClient()

// Custom queries
const result = await payload.find({
  collection: 'services',
  where: {
    and: [
      { status: { equals: 'published' } },
      { featured: { equals: true } }
    ]
  },
  sort: 'order',
  limit: 5
})
```

## Content Management Workflow

### 1. Content Creation
1. Log into admin panel at `/admin`
2. Navigate to desired collection
3. Click "Create New"
4. Fill in required fields
5. Save as draft for review

### 2. Content Review and Publishing
1. Review draft content
2. Verify all required fields are complete
3. Check SEO settings
4. Change status from "draft" to "published"
5. Content becomes available on the website

### 3. Media Management
1. Upload images through Media collection
2. Add descriptive alt text and captions
3. Select appropriate category
4. Images are automatically optimized and resized

## Security and Access Control

### User Roles
- **Super Admin**: Full access to all collections and settings
- **Admin**: Access to content collections, limited settings access
- **Editor**: Content creation and editing only

### Collection Access Rules
- Public read access for published content
- Authenticated write access based on user roles
- Draft content only visible to authenticated users

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization
- Automatic image resizing (thumbnail, card, hero, logo sizes)
- WebP conversion for modern browsers
- Lazy loading implementation
- CDN-ready media URLs

### Caching Strategy
- Payload client connection caching
- API response caching (implement with Next.js caching)
- Static generation for published content
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for content updates

## Migrating Existing Data

The static data from `lib/data/workflo-data.ts` can be migrated to Payload CMS:

1. **Services**: Use the seeding script as a template to import existing service data
2. **Team Members**: Import team data with photos from `public/images/team/`
3. **Client Logos**: Import client logos from `public/images/logos/`
4. **Company Information**: Import existing company values and statistics

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set in production:
- `PAYLOAD_SECRET` (use a strong, unique secret)
- `DATABASE_URL` (production database connection)
- `PAYLOAD_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` (production domain)

### Database
- Use a production-ready PostgreSQL instance
- Set up automated backups
- Configure connection pooling for performance

### Media Storage
- Consider cloud storage solutions (Cloudinary, AWS S3)
- Configure CDN for media delivery
- Implement proper image optimization pipeline

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Database connection monitoring
- Payload admin panel accessibility
- API endpoint response times
- Image delivery performance

### Content Backup
- Regular database backups
- Media file backup strategy
- Content versioning and rollback procedures

### Updates and Security
- Regular Payload CMS updates
- Security patch monitoring
- Access log review and analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL in environment variables
   - Check PostgreSQL server status
   - Confirm database permissions

2. **Admin Panel Access Issues**
   - Verify PAYLOAD_SECRET is set
   - Check user credentials
   - Review browser console for errors

3. **Image Upload Problems**
   - Verify Sharp dependency is installed
   - Check file permissions in media directory
   - Review file size limits

4. **API Response Issues**
