# ADR-001: CMS Architecture Decision for News/Blog System

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Deciders**: Chief Architect Agent, Development Team  
**Technical Story**: [CMS_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md](./CMS_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md)

---

## Context

The Workflo new project currently implements a dual-CMS architecture with both Supabase and Payload CMS for managing news and blog content. This approach has created architectural complexity and compatibility issues:

### Current Issues
- **Payload CMS Incompatibility**: Cannot function with Next.js 15 due to `useConfig()` destructuring errors
- **Dual Database Complexity**: Both Supabase and local PostgreSQL configured, creating potential inconsistencies
- **Authentication Gap**: No proper authentication system for content management
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Two different CMS systems require separate maintenance

### Business Requirements
- Robust content management for news articles and blog posts
- Multi-language support (Dutch/English)
- SEO-friendly content delivery
- Integration with external sources (RSS, LinkedIn)
- Scalable architecture for future growth
- Editor-friendly interface for non-technical users
- Cost-effective solution

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with Next.js 15
- TypeScript requirement
- Existing Supabase integration
- Need for real-time updates
- Mobile-responsive content management

---

## Decision

We will adopt a **Supabase-First Architecture** and deprecate Payload CMS from the system.

### Chosen Architecture

    A[Next.js 15 Frontend] --> B[Custom CMS Dashboard]
    A --> C[Public News/Blog Pages]
    B --> D[ArticleService Layer]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Supabase PostgreSQL]
    D --> F[localStorage Fallback]
    E --> G[Supabase Auth & RLS]
    E --> H[Supabase Storage]
    I[External APIs] --> D

        J[RSS Feeds]
        K[LinkedIn API]
        L[Newsletter Service]
    end
    I --> J
    I --> K
    I --> L
```

### Core Components

1. **Database Layer**: Supabase PostgreSQL with comprehensive articles schema
2. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with row-level security
3. **Content Management**: Enhanced custom CMS dashboard
4. **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for media assets
5. **API Layer**: Next.js API routes with robust error handling
6. **Frontend**: React-based content delivery with SSG/SSR

---

## Rationale

### Why Supabase-First?

#### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Single Source of Truth**: Eliminates dual-database complexity
- **Next.js 15 Compatibility**: No compatibility issues
- **Built-in Authentication**: Robust auth system with RLS
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Live updates for collaborative editing
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling database with global CDN
- **File Storage**: Integrated media management
- **Cost Effective**: Excellent price-performance ratio
- **Developer Experience**: Great TypeScript support and tooling

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs
- **Custom UI Development**: Need to build admin interface (already done)
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependency on Supabase ecosystem
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs Supabase expertise

### Why Not Payload CMS?

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Next.js 15 Incompatibility**: Fundamental blocking issue
- **Additional Complexity**: Separate database and deployment requirements
- **Development Overhead**: Need to maintain compatibility layers
- **Resource Usage**: Additional server resources required

### Why Not Alternative Headless CMS?

#### Considered Options
- **Sanity**: Rich editor but adds complexity and cost
- **Strapi**: Open source but requires separate hosting
- **Contentful**: Enterprise features but expensive for current needs
- **Ghost**: Blog-focused but limited customization

#### Decision Factors
- Current Supabase integration is working well
- Custom CMS dashboard already built and functional
- Team expertise with React/TypeScript
- Cost considerations favor integrated solution

## Alternatives Considered

### Option A: Keep Dual CMS Architecture
**Rejected** because:
- Payload CMS compatibility issues with Next.js 15
- Unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead
- Higher infrastructure costs
- Potential data consistency issues

### Option B: Downgrade to Next.js 14
**Rejected** because:
- Loses Next.js 15 performance improvements
- Blocks future upgrades
- Technical debt accumulation
- Goes against modern development practices

### Option C: Switch to External Headless CMS
**Rejected** because:
- Additional monthly costs ($50-200+/month)
- Migration complexity
- Existing Supabase investment
- Current custom CMS already meets needs

### Option D: Pure Static Site Generation
**Rejected** because:
- Loses real-time content management
- Limited content editor capabilities
- Complex content workflow requirements
- Doesn't meet business requirements for dynamic content
